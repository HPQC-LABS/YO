 Use experimental data input file:  ./abInitio3.4                 
 Uncertainties for transitions involving quasibound levels modified to:
                    SQRT{(u(i;exp)**2 + ( 0.20*width)**2}
 Fit uses standard  1/[uncertainty(i)]**2  data weighting
 Non-linear fits are allowed a maximum of  CYCMAX= 100 cycles

 For state   1X 
    integrate from   RMIN= 1.40   to   RMAX= 10.00   with mesh   RH= 0.00100
 ==============================================================================

 State 1X  represented by an MLR(p=**, q=**) potential defined in terms of
 ========  exponent coefficient:  beta(R)= betaINF*y* +(1-y*)*Sum{beta_i*y*^i}
                                                              for  i= 0 to  8
        with radial variable:   y_{p,q} = (R^q - 1.790000^q)/(R^q + 1.790000^q)
    uLR inverse-power terms incorporate DS-type damping with   rhoAB= 1.0000000
           defined to give very short-range  Dm(r)*Cm/r^m  behaviour   r^{-1.0}
        Dm(r)= [1 - exp(- 3.30(rhoAB*r)/m - 0.423(rhoAB*r)^2/sqrt{m})]^{m-1.0}
                                                C6= 3.5181470D+06[cm-1 Ang^6]
                                                C8= 4.7234730D+07[cm-1 Ang^8]
                                               C10= 6.8124077D+04[cm-1 Ang^{10}]
                    These constants yield:   betaINF= -0.2776503676

    Since this state has (projected) electronic angular momentum  OMEGA=-2
          eigenvalue calculations use centrifugal potential  [J*(J+1) - 4]/r**2

 Including BOB term makes centrifugal potential strength factor   [J(J+1) + 2]

 Fitting   11  free parameters to    21  transitions yields  DSE= 0.14930238E-01
 ========================================================================
 ==============================================================================

 State 1X  represented by an MLR(p=**, q=**) potential defined in terms of
 ========  exponent coefficient:  beta(R)= betaINF*y* +(1-y*)*Sum{beta_i*y*^i}
                                                              for  i= 0 to  8
        with radial variable:   y_{p,q} = (R^q - 1.790000^q)/(R^q + 1.790000^q)
    uLR inverse-power terms incorporate DS-type damping with   rhoAB= 1.0000000
           defined to give very short-range  Dm(r)*Cm/r^m  behaviour   r^{-1.0}
        Dm(r)= [1 - exp(- 3.30(rhoAB*r)/m - 0.423(rhoAB*r)^2/sqrt{m})]^{m-1.0}
                                                C6= 3.5181470D+06[cm-1 Ang^6]

                    These constants yield:   betaINF= -0.2778105110

    Since this state has (projected) electronic angular momentum  OMEGA=-2
          eigenvalue calculations use centrifugal potential  [J*(J+1) - 4]/r**2

 Including BOB term makes centrifugal potential strength factor   [J(J+1) + 2]
